# machin-learning-algorithms

This project is coded in Ruby with hand-written machine learning algorithm implementations (includes logistic regression with L2 regularization and random forest).

The home_credit_risk.ipynb is the final model for this project with random forest.

Dataset for this model is gathered from SQL database which is not provided here. So the dataset cannot be loaded without some modification. But alternative csv files are available on https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data. 

Some test and plot related functions in rb files.
